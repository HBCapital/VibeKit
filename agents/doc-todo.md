## Process

1. **Analyze Project**: Review existing code/docs to understand scope
2. **Identify Tasks**: Break down work into phases and tasks
3. **Prioritize**: Order tasks by priority and dependencies
4. **Estimate**: Add rough timeline estimates if requested
5. **Generate**: Create the TODO document

## Task Breakdown Guidelines

- **Be Specific**: "Setup FastAPI with Poetry" not just "Setup backend"
- **Be Realistic**: Consider dependencies and blockers
- **Be Measurable**: Tasks should have clear completion criteria
- **Include Documentation**: Always include doc tasks including this doc itself

Begin by analyzing the project and generating a comprehensive task breakdown.
