# Generate Risks & Issues Document

You are tasked with documenting project risks and known issues.

## Purpose

Create RISKS.md that documents potential risks, known issues, and mitigation strategies.

## Document Structure

```markdown
# Risk Assessment & Known Issues

> Document of risks, trade-offs, and known issues

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Technical Limitations

| Limitation     | Impact   | Mitigation   |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| {Limitation 1} | {Impact} | {Mitigation} |

### Scope Limitations

- {What the project doesn't do}

## 🔴 High-Risk Areas

### Risk 1: {Name}

**Description**: {What could go wrong}

**Probability**: High/Medium/Low

**Impact**: High/Medium/Low

**Mitigation**:

- Strategy 1
- Strategy 2

**Contingency Plan**: {If it happens, do this}

## 📊 Risk Matrix

| Risk     | Probability | Impact | Priority |
| -------- | ----------- | ------ | -------- |
| {Risk 1} | High        | High   | P0       |
| {Risk 2} | Low         | High   | P1       |

## 📋 Trade-offs

| Decision | Benefit      | Trade-off             |
| -------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| {Choice} | {Why chosen} | {What was sacrificed} |
```

## Process

1. **Analyze Project**: Technical stack, dependencies, scope
2. **Identify Risks**: Technical, business, operational
3. **Assess Impact**: Probability and impact matrix
4. **Document Mitigations**: Prevention and contingency
5. **Generate**: Create RISKS.md

Begin by analyzing the project and documenting risks and issues.
